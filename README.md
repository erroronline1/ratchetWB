## Estimate Workbench 

A FreeCAD workbench to create ratchets

### Background
Like workbenches that create gears this workbench is supposed to create ratchets. You can choose between ratchets that allow only for one direction or ratches that allow both directions. It is expected to make these type of functional units easier to create than sketching them manually.

The workbench has been developed and tested with FreeCAD v0.20

### Customize

Different languages according to user settings are technically supported - but actually restricted to english by default and german due to my own limitations. This might be more proof-of-concept than actually useful but feel free to contribute :) Since one does usually not switch languages by the minute I did not bother finding out how to update during runtime yet, so FreeCad has to be restarted to have language-changes take effect on this workbench.
